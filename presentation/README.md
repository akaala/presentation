Bash Bang (!) Commands

Bash also has some handy features that use the ! (bang) to allow you to do some funky stuff with bash commands.

!! - run last command

!blah – run the most recent command that starts with ‘blah’ (e.g. !ls)

!blah:p – print out the command that !blah would run (also adds it as the latest command in the command history)

!$ – the last word of the previous command (same as Alt + .)

!$:p – print out the word that !$ would substitute

!* – the previous command except for the last word (e.g. if you type ‘find some_file.txt /‘, then !* would give you ‘find some_file.txt‘)

!*:p – print out what !* would substitute

There is one more handy thing you can do. This involves using the ^^ ‘command’. If you type a command and run it, you can re-run the same command but substitute a piece of text for another piece of text using ^^ e.g.:
